## London Bike Rides
The London Bike Sharing Dataset on Kaggle includes detailed information on bike-sharing usage in London, covering hourly data from 2015 to 2017. It contains variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, season, and weather conditions, along with the count of bike rentals.

The detailed dataset can be found on [London bike sharing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset/data) in Kaggle.com.

## Objective
We are going to analyze the London Bike Rides data collected. This dataset contains information about the amounts of bike rides and varied conditions of the environment.

## Python
In the Python section, I used the Pandas library to inspect and transform the London Bike Sharing Dataset for efficient analysis and visualization. After that I exported the transformed DataFrame to an Excel file (xlsx format) for further visualization in Tableau

## Tableau
I visualized the London bike-sharing data using Tableau to uncover key trends and insights. This included analyzing rental patterns over time, examining the impact of weather conditions like temperature and wind speed on ride counts, and identifying peak usage periods. Tableauâ€™s interactive capabilities allowed for dynamic exploration, such as filtering by date ranges and applying moving averages to highlight seasonal variations. These visualizations provide a comprehensive view of factors influencing bike-sharing demand in London.

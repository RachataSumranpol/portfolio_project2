# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demand skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills treding for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand and High Paying)

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

* __Python:__ The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find important insights. I also used the following Python libraries:
    * __Pandas Library:__ This was used to analyze the data
    * __Matplotlib Library:__ This was used to create the visualization
    * __Seaborn Library:__ Help me create more advanced visuals.
* __Jupyter Notebooks:__ The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
* __Visual Studio Code:__ My go-to for executing my Python scripts.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the step taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I started by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning task.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleaning
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)

```
## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in United States.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']

```

# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

to find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlight the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].invert_yaxis()
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)

fig.suptitle('Counts of Top Skills in Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5) # fix the overlap
plt.show()
```

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/RachataSumranpol/portfolio_project2/blob/main/Data%20Job%20Market%20Analysis/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```
### Results

*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles*

### Insights

* There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.
* Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.
* The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater varince in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analyst

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase thses.

#### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analystsr')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()
```
#### Results

Here's the breakdown of the highest paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:
